# Abstract
For our final project, we asked ourselves one main question: Can we create a machine learning model that generates coherent and contextually appropriate rap lyrics based on a user-provided prompt? We aimed to explore the realm of rap music and its lyrical structures, starting with collecting a dataset consisting of lyrics from eleven notable rap artists. We first implemented text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to clean and standardize the data. With this, we examined word usage patterns, common phrases, and thematic elements through data visualization. Building on these insights, we created additional functions, such as identifying popular rhymes and generating artist-specific verses. Ultimately, we decided to work with a transformer model and a large language model (LLM) to build a rap lyric generator. We evaluated the generated lyrics and refined the model iteratively by adjusting hyperparameters and improving the data preprocessing methodology. Our final model could generate rap lyrics based on prompts that varied in style and theme. Even certain patterns emerged, highlighting the influence of individual artist styles on the generated text! All in all, we identified that the model could produce coherent verses while maintaining thematic consistency. Further improvements could include incorporating more artist diversity in the dataset for richer outputs and developing a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.

# Introduction
Music is an essential part of everyone’s day to day life. Although it is easy to push aside some “sound” or “noise”, it is linguistically important on how we perceive what is around us. Rap is one of the most popular genres that are heavily based on language. Our research question pertains to rap music and the language that is implemented in it. What message does rap generally give out? How does it show significance in the identity of the rappers and the culture that they come from and foster thereafter? How does music change language or work around it? What is the symbiotic relationship between spoken words and physical sounds? It is important we identify human society and culture through what is considered a universal language, music.

# Literature Review
Throughout the years, there have been many instances of researching the ties between music and language. There have been studies shown that music and speech are similar in the ways our neurological components process these two. Reading and writing skills are directly ties to phonetics, pitch awareness, and musical expertise. (Dege and Schwarzer, 2011; Loui et al., 2011) Many children benefit from incorporating music into their learning regimen. Rap music in particular seems to be an untapped field in research, although it is arguably the most linguistically dependent genre of music.

# Methodology
In our working with the dataset and developing our methodology. At first, we wanted to delve into web scraping and see if we could create and process our own data. In our attempts to do so, we ended up not being able to scrape much data before the websites became unresponsive. We first tried to scrape azlyrics.com, and the webpage ended up blocking us from scraping. Then we attempted to use the Genius API in order to scrape lyrics from Genius directly. This attempt also failed as the API started to not work on us as well. However, after a multitude of attempts, we concluded that it would be in our best interest to see if we could search for a dataset that pertained to what we were looking for. Using Kaggle, we found a rap lyrics dataset which ended up perfect for our purposes. 
	This dataset was composed of 11 rappers, 9 of which were male and 2 that were female. This is an obvious discrepancy that we chose to overlook in order to proceed with the making of our model. In the analysis, our most important goal was to figure out the pattern of speech among the rappers. In order to do so, we decided to visualize the word frequency within the dataset. Doing so confirmed some suspicions of language in general and that is to say, filler words are particularly important in the making of rap. That being said, it is definitely a generalization, but we believe that when writing speech to song and following a beat, filler words similar to the word “like” is necessary to facilitate the message. Even among individual rappers, the word “like” is most frequently used. 

# Result
After our visualizations and proper analysis of our dataset, we ultimately decided to set up a machine learning model using the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate rap lyrics. Note that a transformer is a type of deep learning model that weighs the significance of different words in a sentence regardless of their position, so for the task of generating rap lyric transformers are ideal because they excel at understanding and generating human-like text. We created a trainer object to undergo training. We set seven epochs/iterations and adapted to different hyperparameters that would generate the lowest perplexity possible (we were able to get down to 39.24. Following evaluation, the model generates text from a given prompt using specific generation parameters that control randomness and creativity. The final text is decoded and displayed, showcasing the model's capability to produce contextually appropriate lyrics. The trained model is saved and incorporated into a text-generation pipeline for future use, enabling easy generation of new lyrics from prompts!

# Discussion 
As mentioned prior, it is important to think about the ways that language interacts with our day to day life including when listening to music. Rap relies heavily on its lyrics and the ways in which it displays our society and cultivated culture is one that has a heavy influence on people especially the younger generation. There is a level of creativity that comes with creating lyrics that flow with the beat but also sends off the message that the artist wants. People often forget that linguistics is also a creative process, how language develops and how it originates is similar to any art form. Through our project, we can see instances of which the model came to process rap lyrics and contextualize it. 
One of the most important takeaways with language is that the way it develops and the way that one talks is often a sign of the culture and life that they have lived. This is particularly true with rap music which is inherently a part of Black American culture. Rap music uses AAVE (African American Vernacular English) and this dialect of English was developed through years of systemic oppression and the development of predominantly Black communities. In our model, the lyrics were often focused on some form of camaraderie with uplifting one's community which could be seen as a testament to the historic impacts of language especially within oppressed groups. When generating new lyrics, it showed the same cycle of language where its speech was to unite and solidify relationships. This also shows a possible point of examination where we can see whether or not someone’s race and birthplace changes the way they rap, both in content and tone. Our dataset consisted of Black rappers and because of this, it is obvious the usage of AAVE would be prominent. How would our model change if there were white rappers? Would the language presented be different for different demographics?
In conjunction with what was just stated, we would also like to see the vernacular of each individual rapper and how it differs from one another. We can see that the majority of them have a similar word usage, which could mean that there is an inherent formula to rap and how rap is written and eventually said. Does each individual rapper follow a similar formula? Is there a discrepancy between more popular artists and the formula that they use compared to smaller artists that maybe go against the grain in some way. In further developments of this project, we will explore different artists and how their formation of words contextualize their identities and whether or not this is an impactful choice on their popularity and how digestible the contents of their raps are.
Discussions of development cannot be done without the mention of how music develops our use of language, as well as message irrespective of word meanings. Music helps us understand how tone is used, especially in tonal languages or change in our own tone such as when using sarcasm. Rap is perhaps one of the only forms of music that can use tone in a way that is conversational. It is imperative to analyze how this affects the youth that seem to predominantly listen to rap music. Does it affect the way that they speak? Especially if they did not grow up around African American Vernacular English. We can see the ways in which it affects teenagers especially on social media who seem to have adopted words from AAVE and subsequently linguistically changed meanings and origins of this dialect. Rap music plays a large part in this development within teenagers. Now there is inquiry over whether or not languages developed by communities can be picked up by another community and not lose the meanings and history. Language is heavily dependent on upbringing, so is the language we speak tied to our identities as people and is it offensive if someone treated this part of ourselves as a facade. 
The results of our model also display the ways in which language is easily transferable among people. Lyrics are meant to be catchy and quick to understand, our model produces lyrics that are inherently quick and digestible. The words used in raps are never too long and lengthy which offers an efficient way to follow a beat. A lot of the time, raps need a heavy beat to go along with the lyrics and because of this filler words are often needed. We can see from the table and from our frequency graph that short words are a lot more common than anything complicated. As mentioned above, the word “like” is the most common word and we hypothesize that this is because songs need filler words. Unlike in lengthy essays, rap is most similar to spoken language and the average english-speaking person uses filler words in conversations.
At the current state of our project, before further research, we have seen the ways in which rap can show the foundations of linguistics in communities as well as individuals. We can also see the impact that music has on society, especially with speech. If we use rap as a baseline for speech, then it is more common for people who listen to rap to speak faster and use shorter words. This can be seen with the fast-paced social media age. It is logical to assume that rap, which consists of quick, efficient, and catchy word plays, has grown to be one of the most popular music genres. 

# Conclusion
In conclusion, in response to our research question—whether we could develop a machine learning model that generates coherent and contextually appropriate rap lyrics—we have successfully analyzed and contextualized rap as a genre. Although our generator is relatively simple, the data visualizations reveal deeper patterns and correlations related to the artists and their music. The implications of this research extend to further analysis of identity and language in music. We aim to explore nuances within rap that may be heavily influenced by an artist's upbringing. Additionally, we are interested in investigating whether the language used in lyrics correlates with song popularity. Future inquiries may also explore the possibility of expanding the model to emulate other artists or genres and their unique songwriting styles!
