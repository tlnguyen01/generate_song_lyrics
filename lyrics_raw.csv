On Morningside, got no stick in the ride
If I take flicks with the guys, I gotta put emojis over like three faces 'cause the feds can't see those eyes
People I shouldn't be beside
When I was an actor, they would go Stratford just to sell food on Bieber's side
Plenty reasons why I'm this way, my girl, that's just one reason why
Seen you around at Sotto, enough man, baby, you love on some eediat guys
Obedient guys, jokers and comеdian guys
You know I'm like '"" in the right shoe, lovе, but you love on some medium guys
I wanna keep you on the beach 'til  A.M., so you see sunrise
Seen you from the stage in the one hundreds, these must be eagle eyes
Pressin' against me, thinkin' 'bout entry, know you could tell it's a decent size
You wanna know the real me, girl, say you wanna see deep inside
If Chubbs has on a Chanel side bag, you don't wanna see him reach inside
'Cah we know some demon guys with jealous and evil eyes
You know that's how Jesus died, you know that's how Julius Caesar died
I bet they were decent guys, I swear they remind me of me sometimes
I'm tryna be under your breasts like peas and rice, you never get treated nice
Fool you once, that's fine, but you look dumb if you let them repeat it twice
Two hundred mill' on the table, I hope I'm able to get this agreement signed
Told you I needed time, but really the truth is I don't believe in time
Feel like I been here over a thousand years like since the medieval times
And I'm still just a cutthroat king even though this is recent times
A man might dead that we're beefin' with, but we don't do grieving time
Fuck teasin' time, if I cum inside you, it's breedin' time
So much for idols, KMT with the eye roll
Knew that I made it when I had drivers holding my last name up in arrivals
Cench might need vaccine when he see how this vid' start going viral
If Lita's there, then the mash is there with grains in there like silos
The morning rain clouds up my window, I swear I feel like Dido

Drake can't rap like that same old guy

I don't know how, yeah
I've had my beliefs tested, my faith broken in half
I try to joke and I laugh
But I just don't know how anymore, love
I don't know how

People got a heavy misread on my disposition
Talkin' loose, then hit me up after on some ""Please, Drake listen, listen""
Energy they bringin' is inconsistent
I got two Virgil Benzes, one that I'm whippin' right now
And the other one, I'm keepin' in mint condition
And niggas bound to slip eventually like they sent permission
Imagine us gettin' our validation from an ex-musician searchin' for recognition
Same story every time, they heckle in repetition

The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war

I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)

So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 
Pac and Biggie
André from Out
Kast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

From Infinite down to the last Relapse album

Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you
Damn...

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal

People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see,

We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line

Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad

Man, oh man, that was a / special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?.

I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)
Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin'  Mile on my Nordic
Track
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
Wit' your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm  and I'm still outselling you
By , I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill, now I'ma make a mountain out of you (Woo!)
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be -year-old me than -year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a -year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay, so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!

Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection, go to sleep six feet deep
I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven, you'd look up to me
And for the record, you would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This motherfuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty 'cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really, I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells, attempt fails! Budden, L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me (I said)
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Bitch, I'ma kill you!)
Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows, and film you
Fuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't ""acid rap,"" but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (Ahh)
Bitch, I'ma kill you! I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours: let us in
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me (I said)
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Ah, haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Haha)
Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These  G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink?!
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before-school or outta school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin'
Air in your lungs just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache!
You faggots keep eggin' me on
'Til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?!
Shut up! Give me your hands and feet! I said shut up
When I'm talkin' to you! You hear me? Answer me!
Or I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls neither, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you! You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me, I'ma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nuttin' but a girl to me, bitch, I'ma kill you!
You don't wanna fuck with
Shady ('Cause why?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you (Haha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with
Shady (Why not?)
'Cause Shady will fuckin'
Kill you
Hahaha
I'm just playin', ladies
You know I love you

Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's  Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever, so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these motherfuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kind of emotional roller coaster
Somethin' I won't go on, so you toy with my emotions, so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't jokin' when I told you you take my breath away
You're a supernova and I'm a
You might also like
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's gonna be that one?
And then once we get 'em, it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled onto you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take?
Let's cut to the chase 'fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake 'cause I'm a
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin', I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you, squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this
And I woulda done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a"

I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did

In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid

I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a % different

Even when I got kicked to the curb
Life knocked my dick in the dirt
I got back up, flipped it the bird
'Til I earned the attention I yearned
Not to mention, I learned
How to turn resentment and hurt to an unquenchable thirst
In the simplest terms, it's revenge of the nerd
In every sense of the word
But all you see is the fame and the millions
You don't see the strength, the resilience
How I rack my brain, but it feels as if
I'm tryin' to explain it to children
So a lot of this pain isn't healin'
No escapin' it, this anger is spillin'
Almost like recreatin' the feelin'
Of / when the second plane hit the buildin'
So let 'em paint me the villain
Some of this just may be a symptom
Of havin' way too much income
But when you struggled every day just to get some
Now all of this hate is a syndrome
When they can't relate and that stems from
Money lookin' like it grows on trees
Yeah, they're green, but those aren't leaves
Sufficed to say, with every sacrifice I made
It's like I gave up my life to fame
All the nights that I lied awake
Nights I stayed up to write and prayed
Had to claw, scratch, and fight my way
Just follow me and I'll light the way
Look to the hook if your sky look grey
And rappers, how can we be
On the same level now when I gotta look down and see these
Clowns that are on the ground?

Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy somethin' I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' a man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute

There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you callin' names, and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the  and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, , smash him, mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile, my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we've just inherited 's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-'s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt

She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe

Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'mma ace when I face the bass
-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
See Nas Live

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in ', I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHi
Ps"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on -
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) ', it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime…

Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight ya punk azzes,,
Like Pun said ""you ain't even in mi clasa""
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 's will spit, niggas lose consciousness

He pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!

Slugs shooting past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God will throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us
May the next one strike me down if I'm not the realest
The mayor wanna call the S.W.A.T. team to come and kill us

Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn'
And still rise to collide with live men

The belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
It got us niggas from the hood hanging off its teeth
We slinging to eat, bringing the heat
Bullet holes, razor scars, it's the pain in the street, huh"

I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air

Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed

We live by the codes of the ghetto
I'm closing this out with my memo
I'm treating this shit like a demo
I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more
I'm in that Dolce Gabbana
I might get after Madonna
I get it crack in the summer
Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner
All this lingo got her panties to dropping
Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it

No actin', never went RADA
I'm a top boy like Sully but darker
Hahaha, what's the drama?
Peng tings still get aired
Left on read then blue like Barça
If it ain't about face, don't dial me
If it ain't about face, won't answer
I got a brownin' livin' in Sydenham
Professor X 'cause, true say, the back ain't there
But the brain is brilliant
And my new ting came with kids
And that's okay 'cause I am still dickin' it
Little man wanna jump on FIFA
So I'm close to the sun like Icarus
Whitewash man then I'm back in the room with his marge
Tryna whitewash that for the thrill of it
No bareback, man gotta jimmy it
Backside jigglin', shakin', ripplin'
And her neck just ticklin'
Tryna hide my face cah I can't stop gigglin'
Them man all hickory dickory
Watch glistenin' but the Rollie tickin', it's
It's, it's such a shame

My summer's are good, never mind
Women doin' CRB checks on a search engine, I can't catch no breaks
So many ways to die, you think we're goin' off old age?
I ain't goin' off a women addiction
I got body dysmorphia, a figure addiction, uh
Our bread different, don't lie on my name
My tax seven-eight-seven like I'm flyin' a nigga
Don't even worry, I done dropped tears
Took a loss, had to drop tiers, made it all back and hit the top tier
For eight years, Good Mornin' Britain, I had to change peers
Rocky Balboa, different fights and the same stares
Cars like drinks, don't leave them unattended in Mayfair
For times I couldn't cover the train fare
It's Oysters, the Oyster Perpetual, the women incredible
The work's seminal, had to change my number on the low, I'm too accessible
Hah, I could've fucked a flight attendant but she just too professional
Are you a virgin, or you work for them?
A lot of niggas chase clout, but I guess it's what works for them
We're twenty-five, livin' like this was our second life
I see the pressure rise, everybody lookin' to us when it's time to get it right
And we can't even get to write
It's time I get a life, it's time I get a wife
Shot caller, robbed niggas and ended up in hot water
But you take what you can get when it was cold showers, no powers
Had to give myself my own flowers
Sittin' at the top and niggas so sour
You know?
Yeah"

I'm here with David
This is our first session
We're just gonna talk about your background
Where you're from, any issues you've been dealing with
So, where should we start?
Look
Stop all the pain
How do you stop all the pain, huh?
I used to hear a voice when I was praying
But nowadays, I don't even wanna be saved
Nah, fuck that, I don't wanna be saved
I was born to be wild, I don't wanna be tamed
Talent's in my blood and I don't wanna be vain
But if I'm a psycho, then I don't wanna be sane
I used to dream of this shit when I was hopping on train
So, so bad, I used to want all the fame
My ex-girl want to shoot a cover for Vogue
Which is pretty ironic 'cause she's top of the range
If any one of you take a shot on a track
My niggas come back and put a shot in your frame
Easy as the alphabet
Three G's in the ring, call me Alvarez
My teacher used to say I need counseling
Couldn't stop asking me, ""What do you feel?""
There's so many old scars that they wanna reveal
We got off on the wrong foot 'cause I don't want him to heal, nah
But if you're looking for a psycho, you got one
I thought I had a screw loose but I lost one
Ninety-nine problems, money, it is not one
My currency's Kenyan, that's in it for the long run, huh
Tears on a pillow
Bro, I shed so many tears on a pillow
I used to tell my teachers that nobody gets it
I don't know Clarke but I know that I'm a Kidult
'Cause my mummy ain't been home, miss thinks I'm involved
Blame my environment, it made me a sicko
Furthermore, I should bring that bitch down to Streatham
And then make her spend a day in a veil like a widow
Kiddo, we seen swords longer than a limo
My bros are blacksmiths like Jaden and Willow
Man, there's weapons over here, we're reppin' over here
We're from the Southside but it's Streatham over here
No telling if you're selling, hold the wettin' over here
Get him over here, who the fuck is checkin' over here?
Most my niggas are the ones applying pressure over here
Fuck assault, I can get a nigga peppered over here, whoa
We wanted more, then some food on the strip or moving a brick
My niggas went to school with the rich and we were broke
Hiding crow in a Rubicon drink
Which is funny 'cause that's how we put food in the fridge
So, who am I?
Someone tryna live his best life
I just wanna take a pretty woman for a test drive
If I bring her to my room and I press, I
Guarantee she gonna see the force like an ex-wife
People tell me I'm a little bit barmy
For my army, I need a bottle of Bacardi
If it's me and a pouch with my dargy
Shawty, you're seeing two stars in the party
Fuck what you heard
I'm a top boy and I ain't giving man a turn
I don't wanna know a pretty woman wanna flirt
Learned you can judge a nigga by the women that he curves
I love this game, I ain't lost focus
I'm a hitmaker, if you haven't noticed
I could be the rapper with the message like you're hoping
But what's the point in me being the best if no one knows it?
Brother I'm a careful, humble, reckless, arrogant, extravagant
Nigga probably battlin' with manic depression
Man, I think I'm going mad again
It's like I'm happy for a second then I'm sad again
And to my fans, the reason I could get to this
You're my drug, the instrumental my therapist
Man, I need some therapy
My girl saying that she'll never leave
I'm scared she gonna find a better me
Deeper insecurities, like
What if I don't leave a legacy?
Money, why they check for me?
Mummy lost respect for me
I wish we could be together but that ain't how life works
I used to cry about my dad until my fucking eyes burnt
Nose running, you don't know nothing
Before I put a penny on the table, I provided for my family
Held my mother's hand through the agony, hey
You ever fall 'sleep 'cause you don't wanna be awake?
In a way, you're tired of the reality you face?
If you're thinking 'bout doing it
Suicide doesn't stop the pain, you're only moving it
Lives that you're ruining

ST, look
I see a lot of man let their jealousy creep in
Watch who you eat with, the girls that you sleep with
Watch who you talk with, walk with, speak with
The first to the motives, and last to the meetings
Ha, all I know is how to work, bruv
Start off as a worker, and that's just how it works, bruv
When I was tryna work, niggas never tried to turn up
But, when it's time to turn up, everybody turns up
And I don't know what I was thinking with the tweets about
The searches, but when Harry got murdered
Man was so emotional, tryna find solutions
I had some good intentions, but I guess I couldn't word them
Man, life's so funny
I got a message saying that the streets don't love me
The streets don't love you, if you died today
They wouldn't donate to your fuckin' Go

A lot of man hate me, but man can't touch me
That's why I gotta chuckle, I'm a Poet, no Chuckie
My mummy tryna wake me up for college in the morning
Is the only time a human on this earth has ever rushed me
Pshh, boy, it's true
I tell them yutes that skunk weed is gonna poison you

Snaps in a prison cell, bodies in a coffin
London is cursed, this city's got a problem
My bro ain't got a bird he got an ostrich, a fucking life sentence

My mum calls me David, girls call me Santan
And fam, I don't give a fuck if you're a badman
You madman, the only guy I'm dodging is the tax man
They say that fame is a game and it's true
'Cause if you say the wrong word, then everybody wants to hang man
Ask Serge about the times that I had, man
I brought the fam together like when Tommy got the black hand
And if you got a good girl, you need to keep her close
And let her in, because the difference is
When things hit the fan, they're gonna disappear
All them side chicks, and all them mistresses
All your broskis and your affiliates
And all the man that you were standing in the pictures with
They ain't visiting 'cause they ain't got a thing to give

Look
You see our gold chains and our flashy cars
I see a lack of self worth and I see battle scars
He has to be with twenty man when he wears jewelry
And you see it as gangster, I see it as insecurity
Where I'm from, everybody wants to make it out
But nobody wants to see somebody make it out
It ain't about who came around but more about who stayed around
Behind the scenes, they said God gave us eyes to see
You see the video vixens and all their pearly whites
But you don't see the dirty nights, long days and early flights
You see the deals and think all these rappers laughing now
But you don't get that if we weren't already, we're a target now
You see, all the groupie girls and think they're heaven sent
I see twenty-five minutes worth of empty sex
To tell a lie, it wasn't my intention to objectify
But I can testify, I've seen some shit you couldn't rectify
You see this industry where everybody came up
I see a bag of weird rappers and some fake love
Fake handshakes and fake spuds with fake comments
Where everybody covers costs but never pays homage
The scene turned on me, people tryna ruin me
Where most would see a problem, I'm seeing an opportunity
To drop a freestyle and kill them niggas that were booing me
I made my haters watch and put the screw inside of scrutiny
Beautifully, also, if I am attending
Security's coming first like I was trying to shop at Duty Free
Where the fuck’s the unity?
Where I come from there's no class, forget truancy
We have got nowt in common
Them niggas see a molehill and make a mountain from it
They see a Cuban and a whip, I see a house deposit
How to stop it?
Niggas saw keys and went to trial for shottin'
I saw keys, learned to play, and made thousands from it
You see the club poppin' when we do the show
But you don't see the studio, my life is not a movie, bro
Champagne bottles and all the screaming girls
It's ironic how you'll never hear a scream for help
Fuckin' hell, why do you think we're going through the same thing?
Depression when you make it, the pressure and the hatred
Your people talk about you, you can't say shit
The moment that you ain't it
The labels are looking for replacements
Same shit, people start forgetting what you've done for them
Everyone in music's gonna take until there's nothing left
Your fans are switching up on you
And they don't know how tough it gets
Reading through your old comments, trying to feel some love again
I see karma
Go to work but God schemes harder
I heard success can come quickly but it leaves faster
Secrets are what my enemies have been after
Only L's I'm hiding in my closet have a V after

So looking at it from another perspective, playing devil's advocate
Considering you know you're obviously becoming famous, so to speak

Do you ever just sit and wonder about the stories behind the people you meet day by day?
Does it make you feel grateful, in a weird way, for your life and problems?

Where if you spoke to a girl then it was face-to-face

Kids lose interest
Parks turn empty
Social media's got us all less friendly

Asking ""Can we go for dinner yet?"" in the flesh
No convеrsation, no intellect

Puttin' pictures in a frame, a memory in the clouds
You know everybody keeps their memories in the cloud
We finally found a voice and we ain't speaking as loud

I spent my th birthday in the hospital
With my brother and my mum
And I know it sounds dumb but I felt like I lost it all
The pain's compulsory, suffering's optional
Takeshi's castle, my life's got obstacles
I'm still dealing with a whole load of stress
I see my older brother so close to the edge
And that there put a hole in my chest
And then they tell you home's where the heart is
But I got a hole where my heart is
Because I let a ho where my heart is
Never again, I had to tell her that we're better as friends
I never messaged again
Every message I send, ends up in a groupchat
'Cause girls go and tell all their friends
That's one of many reasons why I ain't sending DMs
Look, I'm gonna keep this cake and I'm gonna eat this cake
That's why I'm living three lives, I'm in GTA
I'm in Los Angeles driving a Mercedes and it's funny because honestly I didn't think I'd see LA
Surprise birthday party I didn't see this cake, coming
I need this money like its EMA
You gotta separate the rats from the G's if you can't handle cheese, how the hell you gonna be a great?
I need a blazing inferno for my enemies
Behind my back I know that everybody sends for me
And I'd respond but I don't even have the time
I mean, asking Avelino couldn't help me find the energy
I don't think my ends want the best for me
That's why they question me, fake G checking me
Fuck the road but if anybody's testing me
It's one step away like a -a-side penalty
Every Santander Nationwide remembers me
Right pocket full of cards, I'm a referee
Ain't it funny how this money that I'm getting came from fucking PA's like I'm sleeping with a secretary
Secondly, your girlfriend's obsessed with me
But that's a story for another day and this is why love is fucked
'Cause you went and put your trust in her and then sent me nudes
I said ""Nuh-uh-uh, cover up""
I aired it, certain girls I can't respect
We're all nothing to someone, and that you can't forget
So just remember when the girl's playing hard to get
There's probably another person that she's trying hard to get
And there's probably a girl in your phone right now that you hardly text
That's looking for love
But everybody wants what they can't touch, so

You can ask your little sister I will be inside your house
Eating from your fridge, feet up on your couch
Tell your little brother ""Butter me a sandwich, spread in evenly amounts""
You think I'm playing any games?
Why do you think I talk about cars, women and chains
On half of the songs I make, materialistic aims
Make me feel a way when I want it
When I got it, it don't ever feel the same
We got different types of problems
I'm getting corporate tax on this cash that I'm making
And at the same time I need to vanquish my paigons
If you think it's dead you're mistaken
I'm hot headed and dangerous
And still living in this matrix
All I wanna do is make my loved ones proud
In this year alone we made three hundred thousand
But my mum won't smile because her son's on trial
We've got different types of problems
What do you know about living in a shadow
Where every single thing that you can do is being tainted
'Cause your brother's in the station and he's ill to the marrow
 or  when I turned into an adult
All them kids my age were going Teen
Fest
When I was getting searched by a golden retriever in a Cat. A prison while I'm standing on an arrow
We used to have cards and now we're playing with swords
My G went from Blackjack to a black Jack Sparrow
I know so many man who got a case on their head that would kill to come home
But their chances are narrow in this world that we live in
Nobody listens, we do have thoughts
But nobody's thinking and I get it
'Cause none of us are tryna play the victim
Any disrespect then retaliation, instant
I know a lot of man have been dodging karma
And they think it's all laughter 'til the bitch comes to kiss them
You know the difference between life and death is one bad decision,  or  inches
So many man my age have got P.T.S.D and I don't think that it's hit them
If you envision, the way that we're living
The things that we had seen, situations that we'd been in
You would understand why I don't wanna talk about my life in every song I've ever written
I really wanna help, but it's out of my control and jurisdiction
'Cause a lot of road yutes have got a sickness, mentally
Like, look
My mummy always used to tell me this
""David, listen when your older's speaking""
I know man that listened to their olders speaking
And now they're all life'd off and they don't know the reason
In a weird way summer is the coldest season
You'll get killed at a party for the smallest reason
One day you're chilling in secondary
Next day your right hand's a memory
So when I say that I'm alone, do you know the feeling?
When I say the game's over, do you know the meaning?
I mean that I don't have the time for this
I need a girl but same time there's no time for them
I got people inside and I don't write to them
It's like I don't feel pain no more
I can't do journeys on a train no more
Can't shed a tear writing on a page no more
I don't wanna play games no more
I don't want my friends on a case no more
And trust me, I don't want a war on the ends
But it's like you wanna start it so say no more
I'm too big for this nonsense, I don't need problems
Meetings, . milli ain't an option
I don't need a deal or an option
In my own neighbourhood
Me, Jack, Benny in the office
I don't need XL, Sony, drama
Our team's faster, street Sankara
I got a lot of love for everyone that checks for me
And a lot of love for certain girls sexually
Texting me, saying that she slept on me
And definitely wishes that she slept with me
Look
On another note I wanna say thanks to Kyle
One of my closest from young and we're still at it now
I remember when we learnt to play piano
Just to make each other jealous, who'd've thought that we would practice now
Your talent's been standing out
Be proud of your dream, you should stand and shout
I remember last year you never had a clue
And this year you went and did ""Attitude""
Speaking of attitude, it's only right I say sorry for my attitude
And I ain't never mad at you
Tyrell, Manon, Fraser especially
I got a lot of things I'm dealing with mentally
I feel down a lot and I ain't got the energy
I need all of your help to get the best from me
There's way too much to do, I ain't getting sleep
And last time I got a rest they arrested me
Tell me I treatment for a video I didn't make myself from scratch
Every lyric, every melody
Every fucking beat
Every little detail in the artwork and video
Everything is me
A wonderful team and a God that I serve
My friends and my mum, my brothers and my girl
I don't want short-term success or a banger
Man are signing to a sentence, getting lost in the words
And it's fine if you sign man it's each to their own
But these clones need to know that I'm different from the world
Don't compare me to them, they couldn't beat me at my worst
It don't matter if I'm rapping or I'm singing on the verse
Look
People don't get that I'm serious
I don't wanna play games no more
And I don't wanna talk to these girls no more
I can't fuck a girl that's in it for the fame no more
And man can't talk on my name no more
I give it  or  minutes 'til your main ting talks
She's telling me that they don't talk no more but I'm pretty sure that his wifey knows more
No more, no I don't wanna play no more
No talks if it isn't money made no more
No more, no I don't wanna play no more
I don't wanna play no games no more
And I don't wanna see my girl no more
'Cause I don't really wanna see her hurt no more
My mum telling me that she's gotta stop working and I'm telling mummy you ain't gotta work no more
No more, mummy you ain't gotta hurt no more
You ain't gotta cry in your shirt no more
Mummy you ain't gotta wake up for work in the freezing cold in the middle of the night for a cheque no more
Mummy you ain't gotta cry no more
You ain't gotta stress in the night no more
And I ain't gotta say no more
We ain't playing games no more

Olders, hocus pocus

But my little nigga in the ends
And he's still tryna turn man history

Both tryna say that they're into me
But they ain't getting no ring from me
That's Pot Noodles and Indomie
So, man just put dick in her belly
That girl got a big back like tellys
In two-double- five, man's not ready
My Somali called Ali, not Dele
That girl wasn't worthy of the bedroom

I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love
What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me
Said you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryna be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin', ""Leave!"" Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more you will see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love
What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love
What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)

Dear Mama,2Pac,"You are appreciated  [Verse 1] When I was young, me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school, and scared to go home I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated You might also like[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya?

And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me

Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that , all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried

Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me

Better days, hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell

Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera
On the curb watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters
I observe so many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen' right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in 'em
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in L.AMy angels sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
Where everybody wanna see
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love yo' hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this motherfucker permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.AMy angels sing

To my unborn child
In case I don’t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say
You might also like
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World

If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you

I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day

Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I know one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Wake up sweaty and screamin'
'Cause I can hear them suckers schemin'
Probably paranoid, problem is them punks be fantasizin'
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why, it's just the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killa kids 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton, can you recognize a nigga representin'
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin?
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nothin' nice
Yo 'Pac, do somethin' righteous with your life
And even though you're innocent you still a nigga
So they figure, rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'ma hold you down and holla Thug Life
Lickin' shots 'til I see my niggas free on the block
But no, it ain't easy (ha ha ha)
'Til I see my niggas free on the block, uh, it ain't easy
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary—
Lately been reminiscin' about Peppermint Schnapps
In Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
Just a project kid without a conscience
I'm havin' dreams of hearin' screams at my concerts
Me and all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dolla
Sold my Impala 'cause these hard times make me wanna holla
Will I live to see tomorrow? Am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say: ""Fuck all of y'all!""
Ain't nobody down with me, I'm thuggin'
I can't go home, 'cause muh'fuckers think I'm buggin'
So now I'm in this high-powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
What do I do in these county blues?
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you-know-who
And these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation
And it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation
Meanwhile, it ain't easy—
No, it ain't easy
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?

If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'
Mama raised a hellraiser, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellraiser
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me? Stress gettin' major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)
Dear Lord can ya hear me? It's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like La
Tasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker, I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me? When I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

What MAC- even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh

Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself

Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride

Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, ""Carry 'em""

Even my strong points couldn't survive

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The ""Where you from?"", it was all for rap
I was  years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction

K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)
I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I'm busy""
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we Face
Timed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

Pray none of my enemies hold me captive
So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a ., nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away
I grieve different
(Everybody grieves different)

Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that . thing They say - came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*

If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk—
Sex
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same"

Everything's a season and some things you gotta go through
Believe me I don' seen it all, you're young talking to the old you
When haters come around look em down tell em “we don't owe you”
You gon lose some friends but those circles are better than the ovals
A black man left the oval
Keep that style you got soulful
The best of the best gon fear you
Sky's the limit see, I told you
You gon be the difference between Mc
Donald's, Burger King and Whole Foods
Do your thang and slip thru ib em they ain't gon have no clue
You won’t need no toll booths, they'll pay attention, Hov do
They'll ask you for advice tell em the same thing i told you
Should be a crime to be this fly and awesome
And to think love is all it cost em
Feel like Jordan this the ball that Pippen tossed em
I'm the underdog and gold is what flossin’
When they told me my chances of losing was higher than divorces
You gotta know your worth and work ‘cus I can't force ya
Growing up I shopped at Kmart and Ross’, celebrated every win
And learned to learn from all my losses
I never signed paperwork without reading the clauses
My parents worked way too hard to not get no credit for it
I'm a trip like Grayson Allen
Y'all never made me VALID
I learn that from Phylicia Rashad and Debbie Allen
I'm the other one them another ones screaming like Khaled
We don't match up, ask my stylist
I rock Nike and New Balance
I drink water by gallons, y'all should call me captain
I was told to be the flow and not follow it while y’all actin’
I'm the better version of what you used to think and call talent
I been bankin, check my balance
You a bet away from skidrow
I owe Sallie Mae but owe my people way mo’
God rested on the seventh day
And worked on me on day fo’

We can both enjoy the company, someone who listens
We'll take the bite off of the knife out of my side in stitches

Backstroking consoling the crowd
Murder was the case and revenge was the way to get over clouds
Above my plane, they too plain to fuck with the child
Complain we fly now, :'s been
And they just want more of it like Rose and Joakim
Sweet Lord, I told 'em kill the board just like a pimp
And I slapped it out the back of the Denali on shiny rims
Shotgun was barreling out like caroling house
Door to door, spread the word that I'm sick and need House
MDs that rapper shit, I'm a Jamla emcee
And all I see is mofos who ain't flowing with me
The female Christian Bale try and fail to make the climb up
Took a leap of faith without the cape and they remind us
Of heroes, glowing like the candles in the shrine does
th's a problem, I could probably even  up
To  even problems, ain't no bitch cause
I'm not one, my coming of age just like Bar Mitzvah
My mind like the Nolans when I'm holding sixteens
Flip flows like tides, touch deeper than dreams
Intercepting, what up ??, word to the team
My underground army like Bane's underground kings
Good versus bad, it's the story of the people
Gave you Walk Like a Man, taught to fight against the evils
It ain't just the movie that moved me, or the music
It was you, and the stories of heroes that we believe in
Murf and Beef Dog, this the last adventure
And for never they'll forget like th December
The gift they gave the world in these fifty songs
Now salute the kings until I'm queen like  home

I don't know what's wrong and don't care what's right
And I ain't sayin' that's it you
Just saying times I think of myself more than I do you
To give you proper love I gotta love myself some
You gotta find yourself something, get you a hobby or something
During grey spaces we existing in
When we ain't quite a couple but we more than friends
I think about coexisting and how to succeed at it
We gotta give each other space just to breathe a bit
I don't want things to become too routine with us
It's alright, everyday we ain't gon talk that much
Just knowing I got you is enough for me
And you respect me having individuality
That's what makes us whole
That's what keeps us happy
Even in love u gotta keep your soul
Catch me?

Slow down is what it's telling me, I'm tellin me, look
You oughta really listen to the signs you get in life
Tryna follow my own advice
Too many of my friends approaching 
Upset that they ain't nobody's wife
I know better than to rush hmm
That's suicide
We just starting out
We got a few hills  to climb
If you meet me halfway I swear I got the time
To figure it out, that's why I'm asking for a little some space
Cuz even couples need a couple of minutes for a mental break

I can be my own worst enemy
But I gotta be my own best friend
I need to take the advice I been givin' to them
Man, are on a low frequency, I can't see them again
I'm on a high vibration, feeling blessed, grateful
Them man are thirsty, need hydration
Please don't compare me to them, that's a big violation
Manna got no direction and it's showin'
See how the game can trick you without you even knowin'
We're livin' in the dark, but I keep on glowin'
My mum gave me the seeds I'm sowin'
My dad gave me the tools and the water to keep them growin'
So when they tell us to go home, fam, I know where I'm goin'"

Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim so I had to get my Kanye West on

Livin the life of the young and gifted
In the studio, run out of drink, all we got is some weed and biscuits
I'm supposed to be writing
Instead I'm daydreaming about doggy-styling Kate Winslet
Snap out of the dream
Pass me the lighter let me light up the green
A million words in my head
Tryna think about punchlines that I haven't already said
I wanna write a diss track but my enemies are already dead
I only smoke one spliff but my eyes are already red
I'll be waiting til the cows come home
For man to offer me a biscuit cos I don't normally beg
Open up the pizza box we got earlier but it's full of crust and corn
We've been here so long
I just heard the speakers yawn
I go hard like Jason Bourne
These other MC's remind me of Mr. Bean and Johnny English reborn
But I still beep my horn
Screamin' team UK
Cos that's where I made my name
That's where I made my change
That's where I fucked up them pussyholes when they tried to pop my chain
Nothing but true facts that I speak on the track
Real niggas know where the real niggas at
I'm a good youth but I will fight back
Out to the mixed-race, white and black
Fake G's all over the place
If you put it on me you better put something over your face
Cos I won't snitch I'll tell the officer I don't wanna press no charges
I'm closing the case
Discharge myself from the hospital
Fuck the constable
Go home and deal with the beef like sunday roast on a plate
See I grew up in London
Where the olders talk, but the youngers ain't listening
I was given dirty looks by the priest at my christening
No food in the kitchen
Two brothers, one sister'n
Right now you're listening to the oldest sibling
And I get so much cake I might change my surname to Kipling
All the mandem raise your glasses again
Here's to another year at the top of the game
Ah we just can't stop toasting
Said I'll be a big MC by end of school term and they thought I was joking

When you come from the Gaza
Don't worry 'bout who's gonna pay the bill
Baby, de nada"

All hail the mighty survivor of hell
Plopped down from heaven to sell
Holy water that I scooped from the well
Fought tooth and a nail
Just to prevail amongst the ruthless as I move through the field
Feelin' worried in a hurry like a two-minute drill
To make a couple mil' off a lucrative deal
Selling train of thought, name a artist who could derail
You'll never see it like a nigga hula-hoopin' in jail
I got a friend smart as fuck, but he stupid as hell
He swear that God ain't real
Since it ain't no way to prove it his self
As if the universe ain't enough
As if the volcanoes ain't erupt
As if the birds don't chirp
As if a trillion nerves don't work in the human body
Shit, who would I be?
Without the creator of this theater beside me to gently guide me?
Some days, I wonder if I need to pick a different hobby
I'm deep in with this rappin', it's all a nigga know
I never did nothin' better, it's hard to let it go
But like a father watching his daughter
Walk down the altar with tears in his eyes
You gotta let her grow
And so I shall, but first, I been honing my style
Coldest around, with more quotables than what the quota allows
You see a top ten list, I see a Golden Corral, nigga
As the moon jumps over the cow
I contemplate if I should wait to hand over the crown
And stick around for a bit longer, I got a strange type of hunger
The more I eat, the more it gets stronger
The more it gets stronger
I said the more it gets stronger
​​j-hope, Cole World
Every time I walk (Every time I walk, yeah)
Every time I run (Every time I run on to you)
Every time I move (Every time I move)

Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age"

On a scale from  to  that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well

Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday

And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

Put yo' motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gon' see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me 'cause

I can't do no promising and

Hoping to see home
If I die before I
See your smile just one more time
Sometimes I question whether this shit matters
Puttin' substance into something in a world so used to instant gratification
I found this instrumental on my phone while on vacation
Ib sent it a year ago or so
I probably heard it before, but slept on it, you know?
Shit don't always connect as soon as you press play
At times you gotta step away, do some livin'
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision
I dibble-dabble in a few religions
My homie constantly telling me 'bout Quran, puttin' me on
I read a few pages and recognize the wisdom in it
But I ain't got the discipline for stickin' with it
Now I'm on the way to London, got a show for seven digits
I'm wonderin' just when did I become my biggest critic?
I wanna be my biggest fan, like how I was when didn't nobody know my jams
Today my son said, ""Dad, let go my hand""
Reminded me one day he's gonna be his own man
And my job is to make sure he's equipped
I gotta make sure he not no bitch 'cause niggas bound to try him
If I said I was the toughest growin' up, I would be lyin'
I had a fear of gettin' punched while everybody eyein'
Add to that a constant fear of dyin'
By gunshot wound, the other violent type of endings
I kept a tough demeanor on the surface but was mostly just pretendin'
Luckily my bluff was workin' way more often than not
But sometimes a nigga pulled my card, tryna expose me for a fraud
And with my reputation at stake
I was scufflin' just to save face
Couple wins, couple losses, some broken up too quick to call it
My last scrap was with Puff Daddy, who would've thought it?
I bought that nigga album in seventh grade and played it so much
You would've thought my favorite rapper was Puff
Back then I ain't know shit, now I know too much
Ignorance is bliss and innocence is just ignorance before it's introduced to currency and clips
Or bad licks that have a nigga servin' three to six, shit

Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive

With every record, I be asking the masses to tune your hearts to me
I represent intelligent niggas that grew up harshly
But lately I've been questioning, second guessing, whether or not I've got something to offer since I done eluded poverty
Or has the money watered me down, that truth is hard for me
Like the second time I got cut from the junior varsity
Fightin' back tears, I promised to switch gears
And said to myself ""Whatever you do, you won't do it partially""
From this day forward, I move with a new ferocity
Ferrari coupe velocity, a fail-proof philosophy
Success is in the effort, so if a nigga tried his hardest
I'm at peace knowing God ain't deal it in this group of cards for me
Some people say that I'm running third, they threw the bronze at me
Behind Drake and Dot, yeah, them niggas is superstars to me
Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of my luminosity
So when you see me on red carpets, I'm movin' awkwardly
Posin' all nervous, afraid of the judgement
And the thought of showin' too much of my day is repugnant
I be keepin' my kids away from the gaze of the public
'Cause these days, it feel like hate is they favorite subject
Fuck it, attitude like a young O
'Shea with a AK
Aimed at your brain, violate, and I bust it
I don't play when it come to family, that's one thing I refuse
Pimpin' they kids out for views or just to be in the news
Could never be me, I piss in the celebrity tea
God with me on this record, this is Heaven's EP
The tale's official, the best nigga breathing, it just failed to hit you
You couldn't tell 'cause you fell for the bells and whistles
And that's an area I don't excel
I'm from the 'Ville where young girls talk grown as hell
That's raw, never saw one person go to Yale
But every nigga that I know done gone to jail
At least once, provin' we the ones police hunt
For the pains, we smoke three blunts the size of tree trunks
Too much hunger, it's no wonder these niggas can't keep up
So saying ""Yes"" to a feature just means I'm 'bout to eat lunch, bitch
I'm goin' for it, no never shall he punt
I'm the one and you can be sure, speaking of beachfront
I'm kickin' my feet up while I write this in somewhere tropical
